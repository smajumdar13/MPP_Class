A. If two employees have the same name, the return value of compare is 0(zero), but it
   cannot always be true, because one Employee object cannot have different salaries.
   In the EmployeeInfo.java file, one Employee object Joe has salary 100,000 and another
   Employee object with the same name ("Joe") has salary 200,000.
