The EmployeeInfo class uses HashMap to compare and find duplicates, 
but it does not override hashCode(), and therefore, it calls hashCode 
from Object class, due to which the result is not correct. On overriding
hashCode in the Employee class, the correct answer will output.

@Override 
public int hashCode() {
	return Objects.hash(this.name,this.salary);
}
