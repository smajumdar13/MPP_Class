The CheckoutRecordView class is created
to support creation of a TableView 
in MemberWindow. It provides fields
that can be used in the table, whereas
the CheckoutRecord itself does not.
It should be considered a UI-dependent class
and belongs in the ui package

The requirements are those described in June 2015
MPP.
